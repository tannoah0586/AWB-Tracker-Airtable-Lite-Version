# AWB-Tracker-Airtable-Lite-Version
✈️ AWB Tracker (Airtable Lite Version)
A lightweight internal logistics dashboard built with Airtable to track Air Waybill (AWB) data from global forwarders. This MVP version is designed for rapid deployment within small logistics teams and enables:

📦 Monitoring of AWB statuses across major carriers (DHL, FedEx, etc.)

🔔 Email notifications for delivery events via Airtable Automations

🧑‍💼 Controlled access through password-protected views

⚡ Quick iteration and proof-of-concept setup with minimal infrastructure

⚠️ Note: This version is intended as a private internal tool and demo for capstone showcasing purposes only. Data is anonymized and dashboard is password-protected.
